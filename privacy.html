  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 1, 2026</p>

  <p>Pinochle Scorer is a free, open-source web application for scoring Pinochle card games. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data the app accesses and how it is used.</p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <p>Pinochle Scorer does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to any server. The app runs entirely in your browser.</p>

  <h2>Local Storage</h2>
  <p>Game state is saved to your browser's local storage so you can resume a game between visits. This data never leaves your device.</p>

  <h2>Google Sign-In &amp; Google Drive</h2>
  <p>Pinochle Scorer offers an optional Google Drive integration that lets you save and load game files. When you choose to sign in with Google:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We request the <code>drive.file</code> scope, which only grants access to files created by this app. We cannot see or modify any other files in your Google Drive.</li>
    <li>Your Google email address is displayed in the app so you know which account is connected. It is held in memory only and is never stored or sent anywhere.</li>
    <li>Your OAuth access token is held in memory for the duration of your session. It is never saved to local storage, cookies, or any server.</li>
    <li>Game save files are stored in your own Google Drive as JSON files. You can view, download, or delete them at any time through Google Drive or through the app.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You can revoke access at any time by signing out within the app or by visiting your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Account permissions</a>.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app loads the Google Identity Services library from Google's servers to enable sign-in. Google's own privacy policy applies to that library: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>No Analytics or Tracking</h2>
  <p>Pinochle Scorer does not use any analytics, tracking, advertising, or cookie services.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>This app does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If this policy is updated, the "Last updated" date at the top will be revised. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy, please open an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/andrefecto/Pinchole_Scorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
